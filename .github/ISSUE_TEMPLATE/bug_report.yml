        Please **do not** open an issue for applications with invisible windows leaving ghost tiles.

        You can run `komorebic visible-windows` when the ghost tile is present on your workspace to retrieve the invisible window's exe, class name and title, and then use that information to [ignore the window](https://lgug2z.github.io/komorebi/common-workflows/ignore-windows.html) responsible for the ghost tile.

        If it is not possible to uniquely identify the invisible window resulting in a ghost tile through a mixture of exe, title and class identifiers, then this is not a bug with komorebi but a bug with the application you are using, and you should open an issue with the developer(s) of that application.
