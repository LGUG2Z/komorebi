# Remove Gaps

If you would like to remove all gaps by default, both between windows
themselves, and between the monitor edges and the windows, you can set the
following two configuration options to `0` in the `komorebi.json` configuration
file.

```json
{
  "default_workspace_padding": 0,
  "default_container_padding": 0
}
```
