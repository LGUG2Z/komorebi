# Multi-Monitor Setup

You can set up komorebi to work with multiple monitors. To do so, first you start by setting up multiple monitor
configurations on your `komorebi.json` config file.

If you've used the [`komorebic quickstart`](../cli/quickstart.md) command you'll already have a `komorebi.json` config
file with one monitor config setup. Open this file and look for the `"monitors":` line, you should find something like
this:

```json
{
  "monitors": [
    {
      "workspaces": [
        {
          "name": "I",
          "layout": "BSP"
        },
        {
          "name": "II",
          "layout": "VerticalStack"
        },
        {
          "name": "III",
          "layout": "HorizontalStack"
        },
        {
          "name": "IV",
          "layout": "UltrawideVerticalStack"
        },
        {
          "name": "V",
          "layout": "Rows"
        },
        {
          "name": "VI",
          "layout": "Grid"
        },
        {
          "name": "VII",
          "layout": "RightMainVerticalStack"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

For this example we will remove some workspaces to simplify the config so it is easier to look at, but feel free to
set up as many workspaces per monitor as you'd like. Here is the same configuration with only 3 workspaces.

```json
{
  "monitors": [
    {
      "workspaces": [
        {
          "name": "I",
          "layout": "BSP"
        },
        {
          "name": "II",
          "layout": "VerticalStack"
        },
        {
          "name": "III",
          "layout": "HorizontalStack"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Let's add another monitor:

```json
{
  "monitors": [
    // monitor 1, index 0
    {
      "workspaces": [
        {
          "name": "I",
          "layout": "BSP"
        },
        {
          "name": "II",
          "layout": "VerticalStack"
        },
        {
          "name": "III",
          "layout": "HorizontalStack"
        }
      ]
    },
    // monitor 2, index 1
    {
      "workspaces": [
        {
          "name": "1",
          "layout": "BSP"
        },
        {
          "name": "2",
          "layout": "VerticalStack"
        },
        {
          "name": "3",
          "layout": "HorizontalStack"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Now have two monitor configurations. We have the first monitor configuration, which is index 0 (*usually
on programming languages the first item of a list starts with index 0*), this configuration has 3 workspaces with names
"I", "II" and "III". Then the 2nd monitor configuration, which is index 1, also has 3 workspaces with names "1", "2",
and "3" (you should always give unique names to your workspaces).

Now if you start komorebi with two monitors connected, the main monitor will use the configuration with index 0 and the
secondary monitor will use the configuration with index 1.

---

Let's say you have more monitors, or you want to make sure that a certain configuration is always applied to a certain
monitor. For this you will want to use the `display_index_preferences`.

Open up a terminal and type the following command: [ `komorebic monitor-info`](../cli/monitor-information.md). This
command will give you the information about your connected monitors, you want to look up the `serial_number_id`. You
should get something like this:

```
❯ komorebic monitor-info
[
  {
    "id": 6620935,
    "name": "DISPLAY1",
    "device": "BOE0A1C",
    "device_id": "BOE0A1C-5&a2bea0b&0&UID512",
    "serial_number_id": "0",
    "size": {
      "left": 0,
      "top": 0,
      "right": 1920,
      "bottom": 1080
    }
  },
  {
    "id": 181932057,
    "name": "DISPLAY2",
    "device": "VSC8C31",
    "device_id": "VSC8C31-5&18560b1f&0&UID4356",
    "serial_number_id": "UEP174021562",
    "size": {
      "left": 0,
      "top": -1080,
      "right": 1920,
      "bottom": 1080
    }
  }
]
```

In this case the setup is a laptop with a secondary monitor connected. You'll need to figure out which monitor is which,
usually the display name's number should be similar to the numbers you can find on
`Windows Settings -> System -> Display`.

If you have trouble with this step you can always jump on Discord and ask for help (create a `Support` thread).

Once you know which monitor is which, you want to look up their `serial_number_id` to use that on
`display_index_preferences`, you can also use the `device_id`, it accepts both however there have been reported cases
where the `device_id` changes after a restart while the `serial_number_id` doesn't.

So with the example above, we want the laptop to always use the configuration index 0 and the other monitor to use
configuration index 1, so we map the configuration index number to the monitor `serial_number_id`/`device_id` like this:

```json
{
  "display_index_preferences": {
    "0": "0",
    "1": "UEP174021562"
  }
}
```

Again you could also have used the `device_id` like this:

```json
{
  "display_index_preferences": {
    "0": "BOE0A1C-5&a2bea0b&0&UID512",
    "1": "VSC8C31-5&18560b1f&0&UID4356"
  }
}
```

You should add this `display_index_preferences` option to your `komorebi.json` file. If you find that something is
not working as expected you can try to use the command `komorebic check`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **When using multiple monitors it is recommended to always set the `display_index_preferences`. If you don't you might
get some undefined behaviour.**

---

If you would like to run multiple instances of `komorebi-bar` to target different monitors, it is possible to do so
using the `bar_configurations` array in your `komorebi.json` configuration file. You can refer to the
[multiple-bar-instances](multiple-bar-instances.md) documentation.

In this case it is important to use `display_index_preferences`, because if you don't, and you have 3 or more monitors,
disconnecting and reconnecting monitors may result in the bars for the monitors getting shifted around.

Consider this setup with 3 monitors (A, B and C):

```json
// HOME_MONITOR_1_BAR.json
{
  "monitor_index": 0
  //...
}
```

```json
// HOME_MONITOR_2_BAR.json
{
  "monitor_index": 1
  //...
}
```

```json
// WORK_MONITOR_1_BAR.json
{
  "monitor_index": 2
  //...
}
```

```json
{
  "display_index_preferences": {
    "0": "MONITOR_1_ID",
    "1": "MONITOR_2_ID",
    "2": "MONITOR_3_ID"
  },
  "bar_configurations": [
    // this bar uses "monitor_index": 0,
    "path/to/bar_config_1.json",
    // this bar uses "monitor_index": 1,
    "path/to/bar_config_2.json",
    // this bar uses "monitor_index": 2,
    "path/to/bar_config_3.json"
  ]
}
```

Komorebi uses an internal map to keep track of monitor to config indices, this map is called `monitor_usr_idx_map` it is
an internal variable to komorebi that you don't need to do anything with, but you can see it with the [
`komorebic state`](../cli/state.md) command (in case you need to debug something).

At first, komorebi will load all monitors and set the internal index map (`monitor_usr_idx_map`) as:

```json
{
  // This is monitor A
  "0": 0,
  // This is monitor B
  "1": 1,
  // This is monitor C
  "2": 2
}
```

Which kind of seems unnecessary, but imagine that then you disconnect monitor B (or it goes to sleep). Then komorebi
will only have 2 monitors with index 0 and 1, so the above map will be updated to this:

```jsonc
[
  "0": 0, // This is monitor A
  "2": 1, // This is now monitor C, because monitor B disconnected
]
```

So now the bar intended to be for monitor B, which was looking for index "1" on that map, doesn't see it and knows it
should be disabled. And the bar for monitor C looks at that map and knows that it's index "2" now maps to index 1 so it
uses that index internally to get all the correct values about the monitor.

If you didn't have the `display_index_preferences` set, then when you disconnected monitor B, komorebi wouldn't know
how to map the indices and would use default behaviour which would result in a map like this:

```json
{
  // This is monitor A 
  "0": 0,
  // This is monitor C, because monitor B disconnected. However the bars will think it is monitor B because it has index "1" 
  "1": 1
}
```

# Multiple Monitors on different machines

You can use the same `komorebi.json` to configure two different setups and then synchronize your config across machines.
However, if you do this it is important to be aware of a few things.

Firstly, using `display_index_preferences` is required in this case.

You will need to get the `serial_number_id` or `device_id` of all the monitors of all your setups. With that information
you would then set your config like this:

```json
{
  "display_index_preferences": {
    "0": "HOME_MONITOR_1_ID",
    "1": "HOME_MONITOR_2_ID",
    "2": "WORK_MONITOR_1_ID",
    "3": "WORK_MONITOR_2_ID"
  },
  "monitors": [
    // HOME_MONITOR_1
    {
      "workspaces": [
        // ...
      ]
    },
    // HOME_MONITOR_2
    {
      "workspaces": [
        // ...
      ]
    },
    // WORK_MONITOR_1
    {
      "workspaces": [
        // ...
      ]
    },
    // WORK_MONITOR_2
    {
      "workspaces": [
        // ...
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> *You can't use the same config on two different monitors, you have to make a duplicated config for each monitor!*

Then on the bar configs you need to set the bar's monitor index like this:

```json
// HOME_MONITOR_1_BAR.json
{
  "monitor_index": 0
  //...
}
```

```json
// HOME_MONITOR_2_BAR.json
{
  "monitor_index": 1
  //...
}
```

```json
// WORK_MONITOR_1_BAR.json
{
  "monitor_index": 2
  //...
}
```

```json
// WORK_MONITOR_2_BAR.json
{
  "monitor_index": 3
  //...
}
```

Although you will only ever have 2 monitors connected at any one time, and they'll always have index 0 and 1, the
above config will still work on both physical configurations.

This is because komorebi will apply the appropriate config to the loaded monitors and will create a map of the user
index (the index defined in the user config) to the actual monitor index, and the bar will use that map to know if it
should be enabled, and where it should be drawn.

### Things to keep in mind

* If you are using a laptop connected to one monitor at work and a different one at home, the work monitor and the home
  monitor are considered different monitors by komorebi
* When you disconnect from work, komorebi will keep the work monitor cached
* You can still use a laptop alone without any monitor and if you need a window that was on the other monitor you can
  press the taskbar icon or use `alt + tab` to bring it to focus and that window will now be part of the laptop monitor
* If you then reconnect the work monitor, the cached version will be applied with all its windows (except any window(s)
  you might have moved to another monitor)
* If however, instead of reconnecting the work monitor, you connect the home monitor, then the work monitor will still
  remain cached, and komorebi will load the home monitor from the cache (if it exists)
* Sometimes when you disconnect/reconnect a monitor the event might be missed by komorebi, meaning that Windows will
  show you both monitors but komorebi won't know about the existence of one of them
* If you notice this type of weird behaviour, always run the [
  `komorebic monitor-info`](../cli/monitor-information.md)
  command and validate if one of the monitors is missing
* To fix this you can try disconnecting and reconnecting the monitor again, or restarting komorebi
