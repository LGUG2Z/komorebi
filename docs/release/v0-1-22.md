In addition to the [changelog](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi/releases/tag/v0.1.22) of new features and fixes,
please note the following changes from `v0.1.21` to adjust your configuration files accordingly.

## tl;dr

The way windows are sized and drawn has been improved to remove the need to manually specify and remove invisible
borders for applications that overflow them. If you use the active window border, the first time you launch `v0.1.22`
you may end up with a _huge_ border due to these changes.

`active_window_border_width` and `active_window_border_offset` have been renamed to `border_width` and `border_offset`
as they now also apply outside the context of the active window border.

```json
{
  "active_window_border": true,
  "border_width": 8,
  "border_offset": -1
}
```

Users of the active window border should start from these settings and read the notes below before making further
adjustments.

## Changes to `active_window_border`, and window sizing:

- The border no longer creates a second drop-shadow around the active window
- Windows are now sized to fill the layout region entirely, ignoring window decorations such as drop shadows
- Border offset now starts exactly at the paint edge of the window on all sides
- Windows are sized such that the border offset and border width are taken into account

## Recommended patterns

### Gapless

- Disable "transparency effects" Personalization > Colors
- Set the following settings in `komorebi.json`:
```json
{
  "default_workspace_padding": 0,
  "default_container_padding": 0,
  "border_offset": -1,
  "border_width": 0
}
```

### 1px border

A 1px border is drawn around the window edge. Users may see a gap for a single pixel, if the system theme has a
transparent edge - this is the windows themed edge, and is not present for all applications.

```json
  {
  "border_offset": 0,
  "border_width": 1
}
```
