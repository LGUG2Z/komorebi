`komorebi` is a tiling window manager that works as an extension to Microsoft's
[Desktop Window
Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dwm/dwm-overview) in
Windows 10 and above.

`komorebi` allows you to control application windows, virtual workspaces and
display monitors with a CLI which can be used with third-party software such as
[AutoHotKey](https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L) to set user-defined
keyboard shortcuts.

`komorebi` aims to make _as few modifications as possible_ to the operating
system and desktop environment by default. Users are free to make such
modifications in their own configuration files for `komorebi`, but these will
always remain opt-in and off-by-default.

There is a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mGkn66PHkx) available for
`komorebi`-related discussion, help, troubleshooting etc. If you have any
specific feature requests or bugs to report, please create an issue on
[GitHub](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi).


There is also a [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeai3-do-9O4MNy9_xjO6mg?sub_confirmation=1)
where I share `komorebi` live programming videos and tutorial videos.
