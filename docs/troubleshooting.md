# Troubleshooting

## Phantom Tiles

Sometimes you may experience an application which leaves "ghost tiles" on a workspace, where there is space reserved for
a window but no window visible.

You can ignore these windows by following these steps:

* Run `komorebic visible-windows` to find details about the invisible window
* Using that information, [create a rule to ignore that window](common-workflows/ignore-windows.md)

## AutoHotKey executable not found

If you try to start komorebi with AHK using `komorebic start --ahk`, and you have
not installed AHK using `scoop`, you'll probably receive an error:

```text
Error: could not find autohotkey, please make sure it is installed before using the --ahk flag
```

Depending on how AHK is installed the executable on your system may have a
different name. In order to account for this, you may set the `KOMOREBI_AHK_EXE`
environment variable in your
[PowerShell profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles?view=powershell-7.4)
to match the name of the executable as it is found on your system.

After setting `KOMOREBI_AHK_EXE` make sure to either reload your PowerShell
profile or open a new terminal tab.

## Komorebi is unresponsive when the display wakes from sleep

This can happen in rare cases when your monitor state is not preserved after it
wakes from sleep.

### Problem

Your hotkeys in _whkd_ work, but it feels as if _komorebi_ knows nothing about
the previous state (you can't control previous windows, although newly launched ones
can be manipulated as normal).

### Solution

Some monitors, such as the Samsung G8/G9 (LED, Neo, OLED) have an _adaptive
sync_ or _variable refresh rate_ setting within the actual monitor OSD that can
disrupt how the device is persisted in the _komorebi_ state following suspension.

To fix this, please try to disable _Adaptive Sync_ or any other _VRR_ branded
alias by referring to the manufacturer's documentation.

!!! warning

    Disabling VRR within Windows (e.g. _Nvidia Control Panel_) may work and can indeed
    change the configuration you see within your monitor's OSD, but some monitors
    will re-enable the setting regardless following suspension.

### Reproducing

Ensure _komorebi_ is in an operational state by executing `komorebic start` as
normal.

If _komorebi_ is already unresponsive, then please restart _komorebi_ first by
running `komorebic stop` and `komorebic start`.

1. **`komorebic state`**

   ```json
   {
     "monitors": {
       "elements": [
         {
           "id": 65537,
           "name": "DISPLAY1",
           "device": "SAM71AA",
           "device_id": "SAM71AA-5&a1a3e88&0&UID24834",
           "size": {
             "left": 0,
             "top": 0,
             "right": 5120,
             "bottom": 1440
           }
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

   This appears to be fine -- _komorebi_ is aware of the device and associated
   window handles.

2. **Let your display go to sleep.**

   Simply turning the monitor off is not enough to reproduce the problem; you must
   let Windows turn off the display itself.

   To avoid waiting an eternity:

    - _Control Panel_ -> _Hardware and Sound_ -> _Power Options_ -> _Edit Plan
      Settings_

      _Turn off the display: 1 minute_

   Allow a minute for the display to reset, then once it actually shuts off
   allow for any additional time as prompted by your monitor for the cycle to
   complete.

3. **Wake your display again** by pressing any key.

   _komorebi_ should now be unresponsive.

4. **`komorebic state`**

   Don't stop _komorebi_ just yet.

   Since it's unresponsive, you can open another shell instead to execute the above command.

   ```json
   {
     "monitors": {
       "elements": [
         {
           "id": 65537,
           "name": "DISPLAY1",
           "device": null,
           "device_id": null
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

   We can see the _komorebi_ state is no longer associated with the previous
   device: `null`, suggesting an issue when the display resumes from a suspended
   state.
